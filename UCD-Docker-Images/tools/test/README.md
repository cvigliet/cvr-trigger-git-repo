#Test Scripts for urban{code} docker images

These scripts test if the processes are running inside the UrbanCode docker containers

To run:
 `./testScriptName.sh DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG`
If no **DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG** is provided **latest** will be used


Each script depends on **imageTestRunner.sh**
To run imageTestRunner.sh directly do:
 `./imageTestRunner.sh -i DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME [-t DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG] [-s PROCESS_SEARCH_TERM]`
Where **PROCESS_SEARCH_TERM** defaults to **ibm_ucd**
